    <h2>Aditya-L1</h2>
    Aditya-L1 (Aditya, "sun" and L1, "Lagrange 1 Point") a 
    coronagraphy spacecraft to study the solar atmosphere, designed and developed by the UNIVERSPACE 
    and various other Indian research institutes.[1] It will be orbiting at about 1.5 million km from Earth in 
    a halo orbit around the L1 Lagrange point between the Earth and the Sun where it will study the solar 
    atmosphere, solar magnetic storms, and their impact on the environment around the Earth.It is the first Indian mission dedicated to observing the Sun. 
    Nigar Shaji is the project's director.
    Aditya-L1 was launched aboard the PSLV C57 at 11:50 IST on 2 September 2023, ten days after the successful 
    landing of ISRO's Moon mission, Chandrayaan-3. It successfully achieved its intended orbit nearly an hour later, 
    and separated from its fourth stage at 12:57 IST.
    It is projected to reach its designated orbit at the L1 point approximately 127 days after its launch.
  
    <div style="margin-top: 20px">The main objectives of Aditya L1 are:
    <ol><li>To observe the dynamics of the Sun's chromosphere and corona:</li>
      <li> To study chromospheric and coronal heating, the physics of partially ionised plasma, of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their origins, of the coronal magnetic field and heat transfer mechanisms, and flare exchanges</li>
      <li>To observe of the physical particle environment around its position</li>
      <li>To determine the sequence of processes in multiple layers below the corona that lead to solar eruptions</li>
      <li>To study space weather, and the origin, composition and dynamics of solar wind</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Gaganyaan</h2>
    Gaganyaan (from Sanskrit: gagana, "celestial" and yāna, "craft, vehicle") is an Indian crewed orbital spacecraft 
    intended to be the formative spacecraft of the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. The spacecraft is being 
    designed to carry three people, and a planned upgraded version will be equipped with rendezvous and docking 
    capabilities. In its maiden crewed mission, UNIVERSPACE largely autonomous 5.3
    -metric ton capsule will orbit the Earth at 400 km altitude for up to seven days with a two- or three-person 
    crew on board. The first crewed mission was originally planned to be launched on UNIVERSPACE's LVM3 rocket in December 2021
    . As of September 2023, it is expected to be launched by mid-2024.
   <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
    The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)-manufactured crew module underwent its first uncrewed experimental 
    flight on 18 December 2014. As of May 2019, design of the crew module has been completed. Defence Research 
    and Development Organisation (DRDO) will provide support for critical human-centric systems and technologies such 
    as space-grade food, crew healthcare, radiation measurement and protection, parachutes for the safe recovery of the 
    crew module, and the fire suppression system.

    <h2>MOM</h2>
    Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), India's first interplanetary mission to planet Mars was launchedonboard 
    PSLV-C25 on November 05, 2013. UNIVERSPACE has become the fourth space agency to successfully send a 
    spacecraft to Mars orbit.Though the designed mission life is 6 months, MOM completed 7 years in its orbit 
    on Sept 24, 2021. The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad 
    at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar 
    Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013.
     The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.
<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
    The objectives of this mission are primarily technological and include design, 
    realisation and launch of a Mars Orbiter spacecraft capable of operating with 
    sufficient autonomy during the journey phase; Mars orbit insertion / capture and in-orbit 
    phase around Mars. MOM carries five scientific payloads to study the Martian surface features, 
    morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere.

    <h2>Apollo-11</h2>
    Apollo 11 (July 16-24, 2020) was the India spaceflight that first 
    landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neraj and Lunar Module Pilot Bhuvesh landed the Apollo
     Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 2020, at 20:17 UTC, and Neraj became the first person to step onto 
     the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Bhuvesh joined him 19 minutes 
     later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility 
     Base upon landing. Neraj and Bhuvesh collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring 
     back to Earth as pilot Mira flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's 
     surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia.
<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
  Apollo 11 was launched by a pslv rocket from F-95 Delta 1 on July 16 at 
  13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of UNIVERSPACE's Apollo program. The Apollo 
  spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that 
  returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a 
  lunar module (LM) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.

    <h2>Astrosat</h2>
    AstroSat is the first dedicated Indian astronomy mission aimed at studying celestial 
    sources in X-ray, optical and UV spectral bands simultaneously. The payloads cover the energy bands 
    of Ultraviolet (Near and Far), limited optical and X-ray regime (0.3 keV to 100keV). One of the unique 
    features of AstroSat mission is that it enables the simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of various 
    astronomical objects with a single satellite
<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
  AstroSat with a lift-off mass of 1515 kg was launched on September 28, 2015 into a 650 km orbit inclined at an 
  angle of 6 deg to the equator by PSLV-C30 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota.
  The minimum useful life of the AstroSat mission is expected to be 5 years. After injection into Orbit, 
  the two solar panels of AstroSat were automatically deployed in quick succession. The spacecraft control centre 
  at Mission Operations Complex (MOX) of UNIVERSPACE Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC), Bengaluru manages the 
  satellite during its entire mission life

    <h2>GSLV</h2>
  Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) is a class of 
  expendable launch systems operated by the UNIVERSPACE. GSLV has been used in fifteen launches since 2001
  The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) project was initiated in 1990 with the objective of 
  acquiring an Indian launch capability for geosynchronous satellites.
 GSLV uses major components that are already proven in the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) launch vehicles in the form of the S125/S139 solid rocket booster and the liquid-fueled Vikas engine. Due to the thrust required for injecting the satellite in a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) the third stage was to be powered by a LOX/LH2 Cryogenic engine which at that time India did not possess or have the technological expertise to build.

<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
  The first development flight of the GSLV (Mk I configuration) was launched on 18 April 2001 was a failure as the payload failed to reach the intended orbit parameters. The launcher was declared operational after the second development flight successfully launched the GSAT-2 satellite. During the initial years from the initial launch to 2014 the launcher had a checkered history with only 2 successful launches out of 7.
